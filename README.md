# MountainApp
- AndroidStudio, Java

Application that tracks mountain trips.

Adds tours, edits, deletes individual tours or entire lists.

Displays a list of rankings (highest peaks, longest distances, highest vertical gain, the hardest trip of all, as well as the sum of all the kilometers, vertical gains, distance in kilometers).

PS. The application is under development, so there are still some bugs to fix, including the English translation ;)
